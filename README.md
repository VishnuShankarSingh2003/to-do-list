# ToDoList(Trello Board Ui)

Trello is a web-based, Kanban-style, list-making application. 
This project is an attempt to develop a similar user interface, add functionalities similar to the one used on Trello to create a scrum board, to-do list, or in 
project development. This was one of the initial project that I built when I had just started learning Web Development. 

## Live Demo:

## Hosted at:
- **Try it out**[@ToDoList-Trello-Board-Ui](https://parthd06.github.io/ToDoList-Trello-Board-Ui-/)


## Key Learning:

- The **user interface is inspired** by the boards that are available on the Trello website.
- In this project, I have utilized the **drag-and-drop API** to select, drag a particular task, and drop it from one column to another.
- It uses **local storage** to store your content so that even if you reload, closed the browser, your tasks/list is still available for future sessions.
- One can use this to **maintain track of his projects/assignments** on his browser without depending on any external application.


## Run Locally:

```bash
Clone the repository.
```
    Run the index.html file.
``` 
Checkout the main.js file for all the functions.
```
